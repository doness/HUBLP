            <h2 data-i18n="privacy-h3">Where your information is stored and protections</h2>

            <h3>Security and Storage</h3>
            <p>We use industry-standard cloud hosting providers to store and protect your information. They are
                up-to-date, set up with the latest security standards, and undergo recurring security assessments to
                protect your information.</p>
            <p>When you submit information via our Service, your information is protected and encrypted at rest and in
                transit through secure connections. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety
                of your personal information. If your data is exposed to an unknown 3rd party, we will notify you within
                72 hours of the reported incident.</p>
            <p>Aika Nexus may transfer your data to countries you don't live in. We offer European Union Model Clauses,
                known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet General Data Protection Regulation requirements for
                Administrators and Members who are citizens of the European Union. A copy of our data processing
                addendum, including Model Clauses, is available by contacting us.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about data security and storage, please contact us at <a
                    href="mailto:hub@aika.agency">hub@aika.agency</a>.</p>

            <h3>How long do we retain data about you?</h3>
            <p>We use historical data about people who use our Services to generate internal research reports and for
                you to view historical information about your usage.</p>
            <p>If you stop using the Service, your data is also available to Administrators for your Aika Nexus account.
                Administrators can use your old data to see historical work records, projects, tasks, and any other data
                collected about you.</p>
            <p>We remove your data after an Administrator removes or stops using our Services, and sufficient time has
                passed to warrant data removal. The Administrators for your account are responsible for your data. In
                most circumstances, they must approve of any data removal or modifications. If you are a Member of the
                European Union and your Administrator will not request to remove your data, please get in touch with us
                at <a href="mailto:hub@aika.agency">hub@aika.agency</a>.</p>

                information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. An example would
                be creating an advertisement about how organizations using Aika Nexus complete projects X% faster on
                average. This is where you aggregate data to make it so the people behind it cannot be identified.</p>
